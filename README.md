### The Challenge:

This a .NET 8 Blazor Web App with Global Server Interactivity. We are using Protected Local Storage to store encrypted data in the browser space.

For information on this, [see the repo for episode 35](https://github.com/BlazorPuzzle/puzzle-35).

The challenge is to use Protected Local Storage in a Razor Class Library, so the code can be shared by other areas of the application, but it doesn't work!

How can we use Protected Local Storage in an RCL?
